# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary of the Pyber ride-sharing data by city type.  This analysis will present total weekly fares for each city type in a multi-line graph by using Pandas and Matplotlib. The information presented will show how the ride-sharing data is different among city types and how those differences could be used by Pyber.

## Results
As seen from the table below, there are some differences amongst the city types.  The highest number of rides came from the urban cities as well as total drivers and total fares, followed by the suburban and rural city types.  The rural areas require longer distances which equates to a higher average fare per ride and an average fare per driver.  The urban rides are shorter and the average fare per ride is lowest as well as the average fare per driver.  The suburban rides fall in the middle.

As seen from the gragh below, the urban ride totals had the highest total fares compared to the suburban and rural city types.  In addition you can see that all three city types had a surge towards the end of february.  This surge could be based on weather or a regional event.

## Summary
From the analysis above, we could make some recommendations to the CEO of the company.  The biggest demand, as we can see, was in the urban areas where there were short distances and maybe many people do not own cars.  To expand the business in the rural areas some factors need to be taken into consideration: Car ownership, Internet access, credit cards vs cash, mobile devices.  Also, a low population density in the rural areas might not need that many rides, but areas around University campuses might have higher demand.

### Recomendations:
1.  For Urban areas focus on Internet/Mobile device advertising
2.  For Suburban areas focus on Highway billboard advertising
3.  For Rural areas focus on newspapers and television
